# Often your data won't have header information correct and that will be in the 1st row of the df and you'll be 
# forced to initially have columns labeled with V1:Vn. Here's 1 way to move those names into the column header and then
# delete that first row:

colnames(df)=df[1,]
df=df[-1,]

# Another common thing is wanting to rename only a few columns, here's a couple examples of that:

colnames(df)[3]='The_Perfec_Column_Name!'
colnames(df0[7:9] = c('Gee', 'H', 'Eye')

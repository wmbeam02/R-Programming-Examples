#Assume column_1 has a rows with date information that looks like: c('20150101CST', '20150102CST', '20150103CST', '20150105CST')
#and we want to create a new column with the date portion.

df$column_date = substr( df$column_1, 1, 8)

#Where the <1> is the starting point in each cell and the <8> is the ending point. If we had used <3>, <8> it would have ignored
#the '20' and returned '150101'. I'm using this to demonstrate the handling of column data but this works just as well for 
#individual character strings, matrix & lists

df$column_date = as.Date(df$column_date, '%Y%m%d')

#See the date folder for more information on POSIXct/strptime and also my GettingData assignment

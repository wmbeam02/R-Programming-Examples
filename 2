#To join two data frames (datasets) vertically, use the rbind function. The two data frames must have the same variables, 
#but they do not have to be in the same order.

df_combo <- rbind(df1, df2)

#If data frameA has variables that data frameB does not, then either delete the extra data from the one df or
#have a plan to handle the NAs in the your future data mining.

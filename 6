# First be sure your Date column is formated to a character class when you import it, if you imported it 
# a factor class then you'll need to add the character class conversion before changing to date. Pay special 
# attention to the separator used in the Date info you downloaded, you'll need to include it correctly in your <format>
# section.

df$Date=as.Date(df$Date, format='%Y/%m/%d')
df$Date=as.Date(as.character(df$Date, format='%Y/%m/%d')

# Often the table will have another column with Time of observation handled separately.  To make graphs with continuous 
# data you will need to merge the Date & Time columns into a new column with the correct formatting (POSIXct). Like this:

df$Date=as.Date(df$Date, format='%d/%m/%Y')
df.Sub=filter(df, Date >= as.Date('2007-02-01'), Date <= as.Date('2007-02-02')) 
dfTime=paste0(as.Date(df.Sub$Date), df.Sub$Time)
df.Sub$DateTime=as.POSIXct(dateTime)

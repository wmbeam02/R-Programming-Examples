# Of course <is.na> is helpful but my favorite tool for removing NA surgically is complete.cases
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862178/remove-rows-with-nas-in-data-frame

df=df[complete.cases(df),]

# Can also get down to specific columns to remove the rows based upon but leaving NAs in other columns

df=df[complete.cases(df[ ,2:7]),]

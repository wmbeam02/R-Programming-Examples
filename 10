Amazon AMI(Amazon Machine Images)

Step 7 - Edit Security Groups
- add HTTP to include Port Range 80
- review and launch
- create a key pair
- once it has installed the instance copy the DNS: for example< ec2-54-184-111-201.us.amzonaws.com > 
- paste it into a tab and sign in with <username: rstudio> & <password: rstudio>
- once it loads in, run ,library('RStudio.AMI')> and then run <passwd()>, you'll be prompted to enter existing and new passwd
- you may not get a confirmation that the password changed (in video it says pwd unchanged but it did change) just test it

Upload/Export:
- bottom right pane in Studo has an <Upload> tab, Choose File.  You can selected a file that is zipped and AWS will 
  migrate and unzip it for you, very nice.
- to Export select the file (check box) then choose <More> & then <Export> 

Sign Out & Shut Down AWS
- in Instance Dashboard select <Actions> and choose either <Terminate> or if you will want it later <Stop>

# For Looping:
# Here are some common counter line commands

for i in 1:n{ code }
for (i in 1:length(df)) { code }
for (i in seq(df) { code }
# Most common problem is remembering to add [i] to the left side of the equation you're looping over.

# While Looping:
# Include a "break" of some sort - see #4 below.

# A few programmer related thoughts on looping:
# 1. Do only the absolute necessary amount of coding inside the loop to help with speed, if something can be done 
# after the fact on the completed information generated data then keep it out.
# 2. Use the <apply> function if possible, it utilizes C behind the scenes to do looping much faster than looping in R.by
# 3. If I'm going to be doing anything inside the loop that has the potential to grow in size over repeats consider putting
# in a numeric cap size like this: <(something.squared=numeric length=10)>
# 4. Some "quit" commands to keep in mind are: <break>, <stop>, <quit>, <stopifnot>, <browser>

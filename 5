#Here are several ways to pull out new df's from a larger table
#The first example uses a column that has a T/F factor variable in it. Remember to put a comma after the argument(s) to pull every
#row with that logic for all columns

sub_df = df[df$column_name_1 == T, ]

#Another way to pull data based on a specific logic from a column (all rows) is to use the SUBSET function

sub_df = subset(df, column_name_1 == 'some_value')

#Since the sub_df has data that all has some_value in common it often makes sense to not include that column in the new table
#by using the <select=-> arg

sub_df = subset(df, column_name_1 == 'some_value', select =-column_name_1)

#Of course if you want more complicated logic just add more to the args

sub_df = subset(df, column_name_1 == 'some_value' & column_name_2 == 'some_other_value', select =-column_name_1)

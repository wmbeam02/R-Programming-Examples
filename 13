# Here's a bunch of examples to reference.  Advance graphinc reference is this website: http://rgraphgallery.blogspot.com/
# My initial observation is that (unlike R in general) Hadley doesn't like the plural of words, color instead of colors (even
# though there are usually multiple colors in a chart), shape vs. shapes, geom_point vs. geom_points (lots of points in 
# scatterplots).

ggplot( df ) + geom_histogram( aes( x=column1 ), binwidth=10 )
ggplot( df ) + geom_density( aes( x=column1 ), fill='grey50' )
ggplot( df, aes( x=column1, y=column2 ) + geom_point()
ggplot( df, aes( x=column1, y=column2 ) + geom_point( aes( color=column3, shape=column4 ))
ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=1 ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=column2 ) + geom_boxplot()
# Violin shapes give more clarity to what is being represented in the boxplot theme
ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=column2 ) + geom_violin()
ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=column2 ) + geom_jitter() # Adds some variablility to <geom_point>
ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=column2 ) + geom_line()
# The library <scales> is a part of ggplot but it has to be loaded into the code separately.
# I could have easily mentioned <scales> it in my Date Manipulation section because it handles those values well but
# it also has some great funcitons for making the manipulation of charts very easy (exp to log, log back to exp & tons more)

ggplot( df, aes( y=column1, x=column2 ) + geom_line( aes( color=factor( df$Year ) + scale_color_discrete( name='Year' )
+ scale_y_continuous( labels=comma ) + labs( title='Money Flow Over Time', x='Month', y='Money Flow' ) + theme( axis.text.x=
element_text( angle=90, hjust=1 ))
# Need to change the Year column to a factor so that ggplot will handle it correctly. The last example introduced <theme>
# and I'll put more focus on that part of graphing a little further down, want to focus on thumbnail graphs next.
